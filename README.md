# Perceptrons_MachineLearning
Exercise in machine learning using Perceptron, an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers (functions that can decide whether an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class or not). It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. 

This algorithm recognizes letters by a vector of numbers (that represents pixels).
